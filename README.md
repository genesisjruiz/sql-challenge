# sql-challenge
This challenge entails creating SQL tables, importing data from CSV files, and analyzing the data to gain insights, offering practical experience in data modeling, engineering, and analysis.

EmployeeSQL

Background:
For this challenge, I've recently joined Pewlett Hackard as a data engineer, and my first major task involves diving into a research project focused on employees from the 1980s and 1990s. The data from that era is scattered across six CSV files, and I'll be responsible for designing the tables to house this data, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and finally analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights. This project will encompass data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, allowing me to gain valuable experience in each of these areas.

The repository contains a folder titled EmployeeSQL with three additional main folders and six CSV files:

Folders:
Data Analysis: Contains screenshots of the results and outputs of the code execution, particularly focusing on the first 19 entries of the table head for various prompts.
Data Engineering: Includes a SQL file named "EmployeeSQL DB" that contains the code.
Data Modeling: Consists of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema for that diagram, identifying the attributes.

CSV Files:
departments.csv
dept_emp.csv
dept_manager.csv
employees.csv
salaries.csv
titles.csv
